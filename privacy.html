    <h1>Privacy Policy for Estimate Maker Pro</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: November 3, 2025</strong><br>
    <strong>Last Updated: November 3, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>The App Developer ("I," "me," or "my") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the mobile application, <em>Estimate Maker Pro</em> (the "App"), available on iOS and macOS devices. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p class="note">This app is published under a personal developer account. All user data remains on your device and is never accessed or received by the developer.</p>

    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
    <p>All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device and may be synced across your devices via Apple's iCloud service if you enable iCloud Sync. <strong>As the developer, I do not receive, access, or collect any of this data.</strong></p>

    <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Business and Client Data</strong>: Names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, company names, tax IDs, payment details, rates, totals, currencies — <strong>none of this data is accessed or received by the developer</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Profile</strong>: Business name, owner, email, phone, address, website, tax ID, logo, tax rates, payment terms — <strong>none accessed or received</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Data</strong>: Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode — handled only by your device via Apple's framework. <strong>Not accessed by the developer</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Support</strong>: If you email via "Send Feedback", your email and message are received only for support purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and Usage Data</strong>: Device type, OS version, app version, document creation count (for review prompts) — stored locally, <strong>not shared or accessed by the developer</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases</strong>: Handled by Apple. Only anonymized subscription status is received.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Local only — no external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations</strong>: Optional (e.g., QuickBooks, Stripe) — data goes directly to those services. <strong>Not stored or accessed by the developer</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>All data entered in the App is used <strong>only within the App</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create, edit, and manage estimates, invoices, receipts, clients, and templates.</li>
        <li>Sync data via iCloud (if enabled).</li>
        <li>Schedule local notifications.</li>
        <li>Trigger in-app review prompts.</li>
        <li>Process Pro subscriptions via Apple.</li>
        <li>Enable app lock and authentication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>No data is used for marketing, analytics, or advertising. The developer does not access or use your data.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. How Information Is Shared</h2>
    <p><strong>No user data is shared, sold, or rented.</strong> Limited exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync</strong>: Data stored on Apple's servers (encrypted). See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations</strong>: You control what is sent to third-party services.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: Only if required by law — <strong>but the developer has no access to user data to provide</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: Only in case of sale/merger — <strong>no user data is held to transfer</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage</strong>: Local on-device (Core Data). iCloud Sync uses Apple's CloudKit (encrypted).</li>
        <li><strong>Retention</strong>: As long as you keep the App. Deleted items kept 30 days, then auto-removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: Removes local data. iCloud data must be deleted via iCloud settings.</li>

    <p><strong>No encryption is applied by the developer — all security is provided by Apple’s frameworks.</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Full Control</strong>: Edit or delete data anytime in the App.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync</strong>: Toggle in Settings.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics Toggle</strong>: No data is sent — no toggle needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer Cannot Delete Your Data</strong>: Because it is never received.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>CCPA / GDPR</strong>: You have full rights. Contact below to exercise them (though no data is held).</p>

    <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>iCloud data may be stored globally per <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's policy</a>.</p>
